Have you ever seen someone wearing an outfit that you really liked? Did you wish you knew where they got it from?
Manhattan College Style is here to find out!  Manhattan College Style will go around campus searching for students
wearing fashionable or interesting oufits. When we find them, we will ask where they got their clothing from 
and how other students can find them too! We will post pictures of the outfits and how to find them. If you think that 
you're outfit should be on Manhattan College Style contact us! Style should be shared!
